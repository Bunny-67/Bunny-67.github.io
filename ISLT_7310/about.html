    <paragraph>
        I am Ian Ray, a student currently enrolled at the <em>University of Missouri</em>. My studies revolve around media and design, 
        and I specialize in video editing and graphic design. I have worked hard in recent years to build a skill set that allows 
        me to be versatile in my work, and that gives me the ability to create media of any style for my clients. I focus on 
        attention to detail and a level of quality that others may not be willing to provide. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My skills include photo and video collection and editing, using tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Illustrator 
        to create videos, graphics, and other forms of media. My experience in social media management and strategic marketing 
        allows me to craft and deliver ad campaigns with visible impact.
        If you require media services, please don't hesitate to connect with me via email at <strong><em>ianray.editing@gmail.com</em></strong>. 
        To view my work, I invite you to explore my portfolio on this website.

        Dont rest on your past experiences. If you do nothing to improve your skills, you wont stay where you are.”
