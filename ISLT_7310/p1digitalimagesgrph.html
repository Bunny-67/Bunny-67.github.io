            <strong> Introduction and Learning Objective: </strong><br>
            For my images project, I have arranged many graphics into a gallery. These graphics are mostly created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, however, some were created in other miscellaneous programs such as Adobe InDesign. The purpose of this gallery is to provide a variety of material that I have worked on, to show potential clients the wide range of skills I have utilized in my work to date.<br>
            I would like to specifically highlight the 1st and 2nd images in the gallery. <br>
            <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Firstly, the MIZZOU March Madness graphic I created displays many Raster techniques in its creation 
            which culminates to the final product. There are many examples of masking, coloring, and layering that combine
            into the final graphic. <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Similarly, with the Frog illustration, many vector techniques were utilized to create the final piece.
            It demonstrates many original shapes and gradients, as well as a combination of layering and cloning to
            organize the pieces into the final work.<br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>Drew with the Pencil Tool <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Drew with the Curvature Tool <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Edited Paths and Shapes<br>
            <br>
            <strong> Design Elements: </strong><br>
            <strong>>></strong> Contrast <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>In the March Madness graphic I created, I used many elements of contrast to highlight and display different portions of the piece. Firstly, on the basketball players I used the shapes I cut tracing their bodies to create a yellow shadow behind them, heavily contrasting against the greyscale colored figures. I also used contrast when deciding the levels of opacity to apply to each layer. The goal was to contain as much information through visuals as possible and have the ability for each object to be visible, but not overwhelming to the piece. <br>
            <strong>>></strong> Repetition <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>There are fewer examples of repetition throughout the graphic, however, repetition can be seen in the team logos. The logos were used twice each, once as the background to the player cut-outs, and again as the icon to represent the score of each team. Past that the only example of visual repetition would be the matching color and design schemes used when highlighting the players. <br>
            <strong>>></strong> Alignment <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>For the basketball graphic, there are many good examples of alignment. Each logo is proportionally sized and spaced from the center of the frame in both instances of their use. Similarly, the score texts are aligned equidistant from one another and the date text is perfectly centered. The whole graphic is, in its simplest form, a mirror between the two sides, and has subsequently created many examples of alignment. <br>
            <strong>>></strong> Proximity <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Finally, for the proximity elements of the graphic, I believe that each element is spaced in a way that benefits each of the layers. The background icons are spaced closely together in order to populate as much of the background as possible, giving the graphic a more active and prominent foreground. The opaque logos of the team allow for the background image to show through, giving the whole image more depth. Additionally, the opaque logos allow the solid player figures to stand out more, as they populate the middle ground of the graphic. Finally, each of the foreground icons and text areas are spaced equidistant from the center and then stacked in a way to indicate the relationships between the corresponding elements.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> Reflection: </strong><br>
            In the creation of these two pieces as well as the rest of the gallery, I really tried to focus on creating pieces that were able to display a wide range of techniques and processes. Both subject matter and the steps taken to create each piece vary heavily depending on the target audience and the goal of the image. Some of these images were created as personal or school projects, while others were commissioned pieces for clients. Each work that I have selected to highlight on my page was made with a high level of attention to detail and thoughtful choices to put forward a final piece worth displaying.
