            WELCOME<br>
            I AM IAN RAY <br>
            A DIGITAL MEDIA SPECIALIST<br>
            AND THIS IS MY PORTFOLIO<br>
        </p>    
            <br>
            <br>
        <p id="intro_para">    
            For the last five years, as a freelance digital media specialist, <br>
            I have been working hard to provide my clients quality work for their <br>
            individual endeavors. This portfolio site contains the work I have <br>
            created for them as well as some of the personal work that I have done. <br>
            As a media specialist I aim to have the ability to create any form of <br>
            digital media that one could need to pursue their desired online presence. <br>
            I have worked in photography, videography, graphic design, animation, <br>
            website design, social media marketing, and more. With proficiencies in <br>
            the Adobe Creative Suite, I strive to be prepared for my clients' digital <br>
            needs without having to outsource any work. I like to take a personal and <br>
            attentive approach to my creations, and truly deliver content <br>
            that benefits the client.
